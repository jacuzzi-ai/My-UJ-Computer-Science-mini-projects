## Project 3 - JavaFx game - Utopian Forest

### Description :

The purpose of this project was to create a game using the abstract factory and visitor design patterns.I created a game where the bot in the forest battles against incoming wild species.The bot shoots the species to increment its score and the bot health decrements whenever the species attack him. 

### Project Requirement / Objective:

Utilising your knowledge of Java and all content presented in this course you are required to pro­duce a single player game2 . This must be your own work! Plagiarism is not tolerated.In order to assist you with creating your game you will be presented with a list of game categories, a list of game subcategories, a list of game genres and a list of design pattern. From each of these lists you must choose one (1) item. The combination of each of these choices will be the type of game you will make.
Here is your goal: Create a game!
Remember the following aspects of game design:
- Your game must have a starting state where the player begins (eg. full health, no score,
at beginning of level, etc.)
- Your game must have one or more end states (eg. death, victory, high score, completing
the level, etc.)
- Your game must be abstracted using two design pattern with the visitor design pattern compulsory. 
-You must have a suitable gameplay loop to get the player from the start state to the end
state (this should have game mechanics that help you get from the start to the end states)

- Your game can be either player‐driven (wait for player to do something) or continuous
interaction (game runs using the animation timer without requiring player input)
- You must have a visual game (you draw shapes or images onto a Canvas)

## Built with :
