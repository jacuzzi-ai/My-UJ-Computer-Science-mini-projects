## PROJECT 1 - UJ Covid-19 Facial recognizer 

### Description :

Project is about creating a facial recognition program to replace the delinked biometric scanners at the University of Johannesburg entrance gates, for the use of the UJ Community . 

### Project Requirement / Objective:

Identify a problem that is relevant to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Implement a Java
Graphical User Interface-based client (Swing, JavaFX or Web-based with Javascript) that
collects image-based data (such as images or video) from a particular source (such as stored
or captured images or video from a camera or file using Webcam Capture) and sends the data
to the provided web API for processing. 
Web APIs provide a standard means of interoperating
between different software applications, running on a variety of platforms or frameworks. Web
APIs are characterised by their great interoperability and extensibility, as well as their machine 
processable descriptions thanks to the use of JSON (sometimes XML).
They can be combined
in a loosely coupled way in order to achieve complex operations by communicating over a
network using the HTTP protocol. You need to design and implement a client (in Java) that
consumes an API we have created (on the localhost, port number 5000) with the following
functions.
The service calls may be accessed using the URL: /api/*, where * is the function
you would like to consume, eg. /api/GrayScale (one of each category must be used):

Your program must utilize image processing techniques:pre-processing, feature-extraction and image classification. 

## Built with:

Java, JavaFx, openCV (Haar-cascade classifier and LBPH algorithm)
