### Description :

The purpose of the project was creating a smart contract for pawn shops that will automate the processes of the pawning, buying and selling of goods given the pandemic,using blockchain technology and a graph ADT. 

### Project Requirement / Objective:

The project demonstrates your understanding and proficiency with the concepts discussed
in class and how they can be applied within a specific domain to solve a problem. You might
need to make use of data structures we have not yet covered in class. In this case you will
need to research the implementation of the appropriate data structure.
The theme for the Project are network-based Blockchains. A blockchain is a collection of
records (called blocks), where each block links to the previous block using cryptography. Each
block contains cryptographic hash, timestamp and data relevant to its application. Think of
it as a distributed ledger where instead of information being stored in a database it is stored
on the blockchain. 

Your task is to develop a Java network-based application that uses the provided graph ADT at its core.It must be a decentralized application that is facilitated by the peer-to-peer network. 
Example to consider includes smart contract,voting system, Healthcare system for storing patient records. etc
NB:Do not implement any Wallets or Cryptocurrencies.

## Project 3 - JavaFx game - Utopian Forest

### Description :

The purpose of this project was to create a game using the abstract factory and visitor design patterns.I created a game where the bot in the forest battles against incoming wild species.The bot shoots the species to increment its score and the bot health decrements whenever the species approach over him. 

### Project Requirement / Objective:

Utilising your knowledge of Java and all content presented in this course you are required to pro­duce a single player game2 . This must be your own work! Plagiarism is not tolerated.In order to assist you with creating your game you will be presented with a list of game categories, a list of game subcategories, a list of game genres and a list of design pattern. From each of these lists you must choose one (1) item. The combination of each of these choices will be the type of game you will make.
Here is your goal: Create a game!
Remember the following aspects of game design:
- Your game must have a starting state where the player begins (eg. full health, no score,
at beginning of level, etc.)
- Your game must have one or more end states (eg. death, victory, high score, completing
the level, etc.)
- Your game must be abstracted using two design pattern with the visitor design pattern compulsory. 
-You must have a suitable gameplay loop to get the player from the start state to the end
state (this should have game mechanics that help you get from the start to the end states)

- Your game can be either player‐driven (wait for player to do something) or continuous
interaction (game runs using the animation timer without requiring player input)
- You must have a visual game (you draw shapes or images onto a Canvas)
